# To do

## fzf

Try and make a fzf-style pwd switcher. Look at `:Files` for inspiration. Also see what I did with `FZF_DEFAULT_ALT_C_COMMAND`.

## Tags

See if I can simplify the tags functionality so that it's just a tag file per worktree, instead of the complicated directory fuckery I have now.

## Structure

Group things. Language-specific stuff should have a section.

Find a way to actually use the same file for Booking & personal.

Break the mono-vimrc out into a proper set of config files. [This article on Vimways](https://vimways.org/2018/from-vimrc-to-vim/) is a good guide, even covering stuff like how to _un_-load things when e.g. switching syntaxes.

## Meta

Bring this whole repo into my dotfiles repo!

## Colour

Use these links to stop Vim using true colour, and instead just use the terminal palette:
