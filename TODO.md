# To do

## Structure

Group things. Language-specific stuff should have a section.

Find a way to actually use the same file for Booking & personal.

Break the mono-vimrc out into a proper set of config files. [This article on Vimways](https://vimways.org/2018/from-vimrc-to-vim/) is a good guide, even covering stuff like how to _un_-load things when e.g. switching syntaxes.

## Meta

Bring this whole repo into my dotfiles repo!

## Colour

Use these links to stop Vim using true colour, and instead just use the terminal palette:
