# To do

## Structure

Group things. Language-specific stuff should have a section.

Find a way to actually use the same file for Booking & personal.

## Meta

Bring this whole repo into my dotfiles repo!

## Colour

Use these links to stop Vim using true colour, and instead just use the terminal palette:
